Human: Build a small AI-Powered Age-appropriate Baby Play & Activity Recommender using python and javascript.

Agent: Absolutely! Let me propose what we'll build for you.
       I'll help you create a baby activity recommender that uses AI to suggest age-appropriate activities. We'll use Streamlit for the interface and OpenAI for generating recommendations. Would you like to proceed with the implementation?
       I see there's an error with the Streamlit app - the set_page_config() function needs to be called before any other Streamlit commands. Let me fix this issue.

       To generate personalized activity recommendations, we need an OpenAI API key.
       You can get one from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

       This key will be used to generate age-appropriate activity suggestions for babies using OpenAI's latest AI model.
       Please provide your OpenAI API key to enable the recommendations feature.

Human: Can get free secret key?

Agent: I understand you're asking about getting a free OpenAI API key. Unfortunately, OpenAI no longer offers completely free API keys. They do offer $5 worth of free credits when you first sign up, but after that, you'll need to pay for usage. Would you like me to modify the app to use a simpler approach that doesn't require an API key?

Human: Yes. Implement Streamlit app with custom styling and enhanced UI/UX. Adds activity recommendations based on baby's age.

Agent: I've removed the OpenAI dependency and replaced it with predefined age-appropriate activities. Could you check if the app is working and displaying activities based on the age input?

Human: Showing this error "The use_column_width parameter has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Please utilize the use_container_width parameter instead."

Agent: I'll fix the deprecation warnings by replacing use_column_width with use_container_width in the code.
       I've updated the image display parameters. Could you check if the images are displaying correctly and if there are any deprecation warnings?

Human: UI is weired for showing list. General Safety Guidelines list is showing raw json.

Agent: I'll fix the formatting of the General Safety Guidelines list to display properly in the UI instead of showing raw JSON.
       Could you check if the General Safety Guidelines list and other lists are now displaying properly with bullet points?

Human: Offers daily or weekly activity plans

Agent: I'll add daily/weekly activity planning functionality to the baby activity recommender. We'll create a feature that generates age-appropriate activity schedules.
       I've added daily and weekly activity scheduling. Could you check if the schedule selection works and displays correctly?

Human: Improve UI, cute and baby friendly including background baby music..

Agent: I'll improve the UI to make it more baby-friendly and add background music. I'll enhance the colors, add cute animations, and include some gentle background music.
       I've updated the UI with baby-friendly styling and added background music. Could you check if the new design is more playful and if the music controls are working?

Human: make Schedule Type optional

Agent: I'll make the Schedule Type optional and default to showing daily activities, with the option to switch to weekly view if desired.
       I notice there's an issue with the Streamlit interface not rendering properly. Let me fix the application interface and ensure all components are displaying correctly.
       Could you verify if the Streamlit interface is now displaying properly with: 1) The age input field, 2) The 'Get Activities' button, and 3) The optional weekly schedule selector in the expander?
       If everything looks good, I can start working on a new feature

Human: Implement age milestone tracking and recommendations

Agent: I'll help you implement the age milestone tracking and recommendations feature. This will involve creating milestone data structures, tracking capabilities, and providing personalized recommendations based on developmental stages.
       I've added milestone tracking with next milestones and development tips. Could you verify if: 1) The milestone cards are displaying correctly, 2) The development tips are shown properly, and 3) The overall UI maintains its baby-friendly appearance?

Human: Fix layout issue for Activity Schedule list, Next Milestones list, Deveopment Tips list and General Safety Guidelines list.

Agent: I'll help fix the layout issues for all the lists in the application to make them more organized and visually appealing.
       I've finished reverting, what should I do differently this time?

Human: Next Milestones and Develpment Tips are not showing the data. Fix it.

Agent: I'll fix the issue with Next Milestones and Development Tips not displaying data.
       Could you check if the Next Milestones and Development Tips sections are now displaying properly for all age groups?
